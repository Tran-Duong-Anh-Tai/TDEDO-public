# Purpose
TDED-O is a MATLAB-based package for the many-body dynamics of ultracold quantum gases. It is implemented an improved Exact Diagonalization algorithm to solve the many-body Schrodinger equation for indistinguishable particles. The current version is capable of solving two-component ultra-cold quantum gases interacting via the contact interaction and confined in any one-dimensional trapping geometry. Especially, when particles are confined harmonically, the effective-interaction approach is employed for efficiently computing both intra- and inter-component interactions. The goal of the program is to make everyone, especially undergraduates who are interested in ultracold atomic physics, accessible to quantum dynamics of indistinguishable partis.
